# Implementing Real-Time Data Tracking and Analytics with Google Tag Manager and GA4

I am diving deeper into marketing analytics and data exploration, and as part of this journey, I have set up my website for live tracking. To enhance data collection and analysis, I have integrated Google Analytics 4 (GA4) using Google Tags. This allows for real-time insights and a more comprehensive understanding of user interactions. This project serves as both a hands-on learning experience and a foundation for future data-driven decision-making.
Below are key snippets showcasing the steps I took to set up and optimize this system.

## Setting up Google Tag Manager

Before setting up Google Tag Manager, the process starts with hosting the website on Google Sites and creating a Google Analytics 4 (GA4) property for data tracking. The website is then linked to GA4 using Google Tags to enable real-time user interaction tracking. Once GA4 is set up, Google Tag Manager is added to simplify and manage tracking tags without changing the websiteâ€™s code. This ensures smooth data collection and analysis.
